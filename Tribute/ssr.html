                    <p><h3><b>2006–2011: Early career and television</b></h3><br><br>
                        During his course at the Delhi College of Engineering, Rajput enrolled himself in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.[9] Soon afterward, he also began attending acting classes under the theatre director Barry John.[17][18] Rajput later stated that he found the experience to be liberating and wanted to continue doing it forever.[19] He featured as a background dancer in the Dhoom Again song of Dhoom 2 and in Aishwarya Rai's performance at the closing ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.[20] In 2006, he dropped out of his engineering course during his fourth year to begin a career in arts and performance.[21][22] He moved to Mumbai, took up odd jobs and small roles alongside working in the theatre industry.[23] Rajput eventually joined Nadira Babbar's theatre group called the Ekjute in which he remained for two and a half years.<br><br>
                        
                        <h3><b>2011–2015: Film debut and Yash Raj Films</b></h3><br><br>
                        In 2011, Rajput was spotted by Mukesh Chhabra, the casting director of Kai Po Che!, who invited him for an audition.[41][42] He was in the process of enrolling for a course in filmmaking at Stanford University but decided to accept the offer.[17] He was subsequently cast in the role of Ishaan Bhatt, a district-level cricketer who was a victim of politics in the selection fraternity and one of the three leads, along with Rajkummar Rao and Amit Sadh.[43][44] The film was directed by Abhishek Kapoor and based on the Chetan Bhagat novel called The 3 Mistakes of My Life, which dealt with the life of three friends affected by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and the 2002 Gujarat riots. It was released in 2013 and became a commercial and critical success.[45] Rajput received a nomination for the Filmfare Awards in the category of best debut actor for his performance in the film.<br><b>
                        
                            <h3><b>2015–2018: Dhoni biopic, Raabta and Kedarnath</b></h3><br><br>
                            In 2011, a biopic on the life of the Indian cricket team captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was conceived by Dhoni's manager, Arun Pandey.[68] The project was initially faced with various difficulties including objections from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and Dhoni's demand for a large royalty.[69][70] On 25 September 2014, Sushant Singh Rajput was announced as the actor who would play the role of Dhoni in the biopic which was titled M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story and directed by Neeraj Pandey.[69][71] The film was centered around the life of the cricketer beginning with his childhood in the city of Ranchi and leading up to the 2011 Cricket World Cup victory for India under his captaincy.[47] Incidentally, Rajput wasn't adept at cricket and had to train regularly in the game for 13 months as well as capture the playing style of Dhoni for his portrayal in the film,[68] he was coached by Kiran More who reportedly trained him in the regimen of a professional sportsperson rather than as an actor.[72] The film was produced by Arun Pandey with Fox Star Studios and released on 2 October 2016.[73] It became the 5th highest grossing Bollywood film of that year.[74] Rajput received critical acclaim for his performance and nominations to a number of awards,[2] including the Filmfare Awards, the International Indian Film Academy Awards and the winning nomination at the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.[75][42][76] He also made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Welcome to New York,[77] which was released on 23 February 2018 and where the lead characters met Rajput but confused him for Mahendra Singh Dhoni.<br><br>

                        Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention.[156][157] In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa;[32] both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants.[158] The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other.[159] In 2012, they began living together,[160] and reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally cropped up in the media.[161] In an interview, Rajput stated that marriage and cohabitation were no different and that it was hypocritical to treat the former as sacred and the latter as a crime.[162][163] At an event, he had said, "I am very transparent about my relationships. I mean I will not hesitate to say that I am in a relationship".<br><br>
                                In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure[165] were denied by the couple.[166] In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in December,[167] but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the reasons for the cancellation.[168] In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead in his career and they ended their relationship mutually.<br><br>
                                In 2018, he was the subject of another rumour regarding his Kedarnath co-star Sara Ali Khan.[157] The rumours were never confirmed as before the two supposedly broke up, Rajput refused to comment on the claims.[179] Later in the next year, it was reported that he was dating actress Rhea Chakraborty and that they intended to keep the matter private.[180] When questioned, he reportedly unwittingly confirmed the relationship by stating that if interviewers asked questions that were only about him, he could answer at his own discretion but he would also have to ask "somebody" before confirming any details.[181] Chakraborty and Rajput were occasionally spotted on "dates" and outings in Mumbai,[156][157] and on a vacation to the Himalayan region of Ladakh.<br><br><br>

                                <h3><b></b>Death</h3><br><br>

                                On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead, hanging from the ceiling fan[1] in his home in Bandra, Mumbai.[184] He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from bipolar disorder.[185][186][187] The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being treated as a suicide.[188] The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging,"[189] and called it a "clear case of suicide."[190] The autopsy doctors placed the time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time).[191] No foul play was found.[192] The viscera report likewise ruled out foul play.[193] On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.<br><br></p>
