                <div class="career-info">
                    <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited (CCL) team<br>
                        a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President<br>
                        Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season<br>
                        as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against Assam cricket team<br>
                        Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy<br>
                        Delhi Under-17s won the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy in which<br>
                        He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya<br>
                        Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports Club<br>
                        Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly[56] and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.<br>
                        <br><br>
                        The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw Rahul Dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent<br>
                        During the series between India and Australia in 2009, Dhoni scored 124 runs in 107 balls in the second ODI, and scored 71 runs in 95 balls in the third ODI<br>
                        And India Won World cup 2011 under his Captiancy<br> 
                        Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, just ahead of the ODI series at home against England.<br>
                        MS Dhoni was chosen to lead India in first-ever World T20 in 2007<br>
                        , he led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa, with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007<br><br></p>

                        <h3><b>T20 Carrer</b></h3><br><br><br>
                        On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide. In the final over, he hit considerably large six which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of Clint McKay. 
                        During the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.<br><br>

 
<br>MS Dhoni was chosen to lead India in first-ever World T20 in 2007. He made his captaincy debut against Scotland but the match was washed off. Thereon, he led India to the ICC World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa, with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of cricket, after Kapil Dev
<br><br>
<h3><b> Domestic Carrer</b></h3><br><br>

He debuted in first class and List A Cricket in the season of 1999–2000. In domestic cricket circuit he played for the teams such as Bihar, Jharkhand, India A, Air India Blue, Indian Board President's XI, Rajasthan Cricket Association President's XI, East Zone, Rest of India, East zone under 19, Chennai Super Kings, Rising Pune Supergiant. In BCCI Corporate trophy he played for Indian government owned Air India airlines's Air India team until his resignation from the company in 2013.[134][135][136] In 2009, BCCI Corporate trophy Dhoni scored 106 runs playing for Air India Blue team against 'India Revenue' team. In the inning he hit 7 sixes and 7 fours at Chandigarh.
<br><br>

<h3><b>IPL Carrer</b></h3><br><br>

Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions.[137] Under his captaincy, CSK won the 2010, 2011, 2018 and the 2021 Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles and ended up as a runner-up in 2008, 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2019 league seasons.
<br><br>

MS Dhoni became the first player to play 200 T20 matches for Super Kings. Dhoni is at the top of the list of most matches played in the Indian Premier League.[140] Dhoni is also one of the three captains to have won the Indian Premier League twice, with CSK.[141]

In 2015, the Chennai Super Kings got banned from the IPL for 2 years by R.M. Lodha from the committee of Supreme Court of India.[142] They were banned due to the illegal betting of one of their officials, Gurunath Meiyappan.[143] He was arrested with charges of spot-fixing[144] According to Dhoni, it was darkest period of his career. He said "The biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually match-fixing"
<br><br>

In 2016, Rising Pune Supergiant (RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team made him captain but after poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from captain's position and chose Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post. Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in 2017 season for RPS.[147]

In the 2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their third IPL title.[148]

In the 2020 & 2021 seasons of the IPL, Dhoni failed to perform where he scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with an average of 15.29 in 2021 IPL season.
<br><br>

He led the franchise to 4th title in 2021 Indian Premier League season. Dhoni got retained by CSK for ₹12 Cr, before IPL 2022 player's auction.[149] He stepped down from captaincy on 24 March 2022, where Ravindra Jadeja became the new captain.[150][151]However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni.
<br><br>


<h3><b>Playing Style</b></h3><br><br><br>

Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman, in the sense that much of his batting technique does not follow coaching manuals. Dhoni prefers to hit a full ball to Long-on, Long-off or Midwicket regions rather than driving it to the Cover region. Not only taking advantage of full length balls, he also displays skill in playing pull shots & hook shots off of short balls, which applies pressure to the bowler to bowl to him. He holds the bat firmly at the bottom of the handle and tries to hit the ball hard and flat to clear the boundary. Yet, he manages to hit long sixes at times.
<br><br>

Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.[155] He made use of the helicopter shot technique,[156] taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.[157][158]

His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique.[159][160] He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper.[161]

As a captain Dhoni, was approachable to players.[162] Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. He used to allow bowlers to set field for themselves.
